# ML_learning


A structured personal repository for reviewing and practicing essential Machine Learning (ML) concepts.

This repo is organized into thematic folders, each with its own `README.md` and learning materials, including theoretical markdown notes and implementation notebooks.

## 📂 Directory Overview

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`basic/`](basic_concept) | Core ML foundations: loss functions, activation, regularization, generalization, etc. |
| [`model/`](./model) | Fundamental ML models: linear regression, logistic regression, MLP, etc. |

Each subfolder contains:
- 📘 **Markdown theory notes**  
- 💻 **Python (NumPy / PyTorch) implementations**  
- 📈 **Visualizations where applicable**

🛠️ This repository is continuously evolving as part of my ML learning and interview prep journey.
